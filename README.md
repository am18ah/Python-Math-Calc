Math Calculator - For this project we plan to build a web application that allows its user to input a variety of different mathematical equations to try and find a solution. The different areas of math that this calculator will be able to compute include: basic math, pre-calculus, trigonometry, statistics, calculus and linear algebra. This will be possible using a few libraries at our disposal such as “Numpy” and “Scipy.”

We’ve decided to use Django to create the website interface of the program. We will use a python framework, Django, to connect the html files to a website. We are going to be having weekly meetings to work on this project. Django allows us to cut production time by using a traditional website builder such as “Wix.com” which is what we had intended to use before.
