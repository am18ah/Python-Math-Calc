Idea for Project: 
Math Calculator - For this project we plan to build a web application that allows its user to input a variety of different mathematical equations to try and find a solution. The different areas of math that this calculator will be able to compute include: basic math, pre-calculus, trigonometry, statistics, calculus and linear algebra.  This will be possible using a few libraries at our disposal such as “Numpy” and “Scipy.” We will implement the website using a free website service provider (TBD), such as Wix, Wordpress or Squarespace. We will use the “cgitb” library to integrate our code into the website.
